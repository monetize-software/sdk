# @monetize.software/sdk-react

## 3.0.0-alpha.10

### Minor Changes

- Expose offers to host code with a resolver-style API.

  **Core SDK** (`@monetize.software/sdk`):

  - `new module: core/offer` — pure resolvers (`resolveOffer`, `findApplicableOffer`,
    `offerStartStorageKey`, `readBrowserOfferStart`) shared by the renderer and
    host-side helpers.
  - `PaywallUI.getCachedOffers()` — sync snapshot of the bootstrap's offer list
    (server-side targeting already applied by the backend).
  - `PaywallUI.getOfferForPrice(priceId)` — `ResolvedOffer | null` accounting
    for `price_id` matching, `expires_at`, and `duration_minutes` from
    `clientStorage` `pw-offer-{id}-start`. **Read-only** — does NOT start the
    `duration_minutes` timer (the renderer owns activation on first paywall
    view). Pages-side hosts that call this before the user has opened the
    modal will get `null` for duration-only offers, which is intentional.
  - `billing.getCachedOffers()` — same data, BillingClient-level.
  - Internal: `PriceGrid` renderer now imports the shared `findApplicableOffer`
    instead of duplicating the logic.

  **React bindings** (`@monetize.software/sdk-react`):

  - `usePaywallOffer(priceId)` — reactive `ResolvedOffer | null` with a 1Hz
    tick while the countdown is live, auto-stopping when the offer expires.
  - `usePaywallOffers()` — the raw cached offers list, refreshed on `ready`.
  - Re-exports `ResolvedOffer` from the core SDK.

  Example usage:

  ```tsx
  const offer = usePaywallOffer(price.id);
  if (!offer) return <Amount value={price.amount} />;
  const discounted = price.amount * (1 - offer.discountPercent / 100);
  return (
    <>
      <Strike>{format(price.amount)}</Strike>
      <strong>{format(discounted)}</strong>
      <Badge>-{offer.discountPercent}%</Badge>
      {offer.remainingMs !== null && <Countdown ms={offer.remainingMs} />}
    </>
  );
  ```

## 3.0.0-alpha.9

### Major Changes

- **BREAKING**: `usePaywallUser()` now returns a discriminated `PaywallUserState`
  union instead of `PaywallUser | null`.

  ```ts
  type PaywallUserState =
    | { status: "loading"; user: null; session: null }
    | { status: "guest"; user: null; session: null }
    | {
        status: "signed_in";
        user: PaywallUser | null;
        session: AuthSession | null;
      };
  ```

  Why: the old shape conflated three states under `null` — Provider not yet
  mounted, bootstrap in flight, and "really signed out". Hosts had to fall back
  to reading `paywall.auth?.getCachedSession()` to distinguish "guest" from
  "loading", which was both undocumented and easy to forget. The new shape
  makes the lifecycle explicit and lets `PaywallUserState['status']` narrow the
  rest of the snapshot.

  The hook now also subscribes to `authChange` (not just `userChange`), so
  sign-in / sign-out transitions update the component automatically.

  Migration:

  ```tsx
  // before
  const user = usePaywallUser();
  if (!user) return <SignInCTA />;
  return <Profile user={user} />;

  // after
  const account = usePaywallUser();
  if (account.status === "loading") return <Skeleton />;
  if (account.status === "guest") return <SignInCTA />;
  if (!account.user) return <Skeleton />;
  return <Profile user={account.user} />;
  ```

  Also exports `PaywallUserState` and re-exports `AuthSession` for convenience.

## 3.0.0-alpha.8

### Patch Changes

- fix(dts): rewrite emitted `.d.ts` imports from the dev-only `../sdk/src`
  relative path to the bare `@monetize.software/sdk` specifier.

  `vite-plugin-dts` was inlining the tsconfig `paths` alias
  (`@monetize.software/sdk → ../sdk`) into every emitted declaration as a
  relative path like `from '../../sdk/src'`. That works inside the
  monorepo but breaks in the published npm package — consumers don't have
  a sibling `sdk/src` directory, so TS silently resolved every imported
  type (`OpenOptions`, `PaywallUI`, `PaywallAccessResult`, …) to `any`.
  The most visible symptom: `<PaywallButton className="…" renew>` failed
  to compile because `Omit<HTMLAttrs, "children" | keyof OpenOptions>`
  stripped every attribute when `OpenOptions` resolved to `any`.

  A `beforeWriteFile` hook in `vite.config.ts` rewrites these paths back
  to the bare specifier at build time. No source changes; only emitted
  declarations are affected.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
- Updated dependencies
  - @monetize.software/sdk@3.0.0-alpha.9

## 3.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- Auth flow overhaul, signout listener fixes, i18n gate, support form polish

  **sdk — new auth API**

  - `paywall.openSignin()` / `paywall.openSignup()` — explicit shortcuts for opening the auth gate directly in signin or signup mode. `openAuth()` retained as an alias for signin (back-compat).
  - `paywall.signInAnonymously()` — headless promise-returning method for anonymous signin. No modal, host manages loading state on its own button.

  **sdk — BREAKING removals**

  - `paywall.openAnonGate()` removed — replaced by headless `signInAnonymously()`. The half-empty modal-with-spinner pattern was poor UX; hosts already render their own loading state on the triggering button.
  - `AnonGate` component, `'anon'` from `PaywallView` union, `'anon_gate'` from `GateState` — all related rendering and state-machine plumbing removed (~290 LoC gone).

  **sdk — auth flow fixes**

  - `AuthPanel`: new `signup_verify` mode separate from `reset_verify` — after signup with `confirmation_required` the form no longer shows the misleading "Reset password" header + password field. Header reads "Confirm your email" with a single OTP-code input.
  - `AuthPanel`: removed redundant "Last used · email" badge above the signin submit button — the email field is already pre-filled from `getLastLogin()`.
  - `BillingClient.setIdentity(undefined)` (signout) now emits `applyUser(EMPTY_USER)` + `applyBalances([])` so `onUserChange` / `onBalanceChange` listeners receive the guest-state transition. Previously listeners never fired on signout, leaving consumers with stale premium state in their cache (visible bug in extension content-script widgets).
  - `PaywallRoot`: `openSupport()` / `openSignin()` / `openSignup()` on a paywall for an already-subscribed user no longer get hijacked by the `purchase_success` restored-view on first click. Standalone flows now bypass the auto-restored gate.
  - `PaywallRoot.AwaitingPaymentView`: added horizontal padding so the "← Back" button and "Checkout window didn't open" card no longer collide with the dialog X-close button.
  - `SupportGate`: submit button no longer silently disabled when input is invalid. Validation fires on click with inline errors under each field; previously users couldn't tell why the button was greyed out (e.g. subject < 3 chars).

  **sdk — i18n**

  - Per-locale gate: SDK now only loads the static UI chunk when there is a dynamic override for the resolved locale in `bootstrap.locales`. Previously a paywall translated to RU only would still load the NL static chunk for NL users, producing a mixed NL UI + EN content paywall. Now an NL user with no NL dynamic override gets the clean EN fallback.
  - New keys: `auth.confirm_email_title`, `auth.confirm_email_subtitle` for the signup-confirm flow (RU + 10 major locales translated).
  - Filled missing RU/UK translations for: `auth.reset_password_subtitle`, `payment.awaiting_subtitle`, `payment.still_processing`, `payment.popup_help_text`, `payment.tab_closed_retry`, `payment.popup_blocked_title`, `payment.popup_blocked_message`.

  **sdk-extension**

  - Picks up the SDK changes via workspace dep — no API surface change in `sdk-extension` itself.
  - Demo extension (`demo-extension/`) is not published; included for development reference only. It exercises all the new SDK APIs: `openSignin` / `openSignup` / `signInAnonymously` / `openSupport`, the floating widget reactively shows guest/premium state through the now-correct signout listener fires, and the 401 recovery flow uses headless anon signin instead of the removed `openAnonGate()`.

  **sdk-react — BREAKING changes**

  - `<PaywallButton>` `mode` prop:
    - **Removed** `'anon'` — for anonymous signin use `usePaywall().signInAnonymously()` directly so you can render your own button-level loading state.
    - **Added** `'signin'` (explicit alternative to `'auth'`) and `'signup'` (opens the auth gate directly in signup mode).
    - `'auth'` retained as alias for `'signin'` (back-compat).
  - Contract assertions in `contract.ts` updated: `openSignin` / `openSignup` / `signInAnonymously` now required, `openAnonGate` removed from `RequiredMethods`. TypeScript will surface any host code still calling the removed method.

  **Backend (online) — also updated alongside this release**

  `/api/v1/paywall/[id]/auth/password/request-reset`, `/auth/email/signup`, `/auth/email/resend` and `/auth/otp/send` now resolve `redirect_to` from `custom_domain` server-side. GoTrue magic-links in confirmation / recovery emails redirect to `<custom_domain>/paywall/auth/reset` or `<custom_domain>/paywall/auth/confirm` (new landing page added). Previously links fell back to the platform default Site URL.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @monetize.software/sdk@3.0.0-alpha.8

## 3.0.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- docs: README cleanup across all three packages

  - **sdk**: dropped stale "Not in this version (alpha)" block that listed Auth, trials, i18n, React adapter and tests as missing — all shipped. Replaced with an accurate "What's included" section. Added required `apiOrigin` (custom_domain) to Quick start and ApiGateway examples. Expanded provider list to the real set: Stripe / Paddle / Freemius / Chargebee / Overpay. Removed broken `../TODO.md` link. Clarified CDN policy: allowed for websites, forbidden for Chrome extensions.
  - **sdk-extension**: fixed `host_permissions` manifest snippet — was `["https://api.monetize.software/*"]` (a domain that doesn't exist), now points to the host's own `apiOrigin` (custom_domain) with a placeholder. Removed the misleading `"permissions": ["identity"]` optional line — SDK does not use `chrome.identity` (OAuth runs via a popup window against the host's `apiOrigin`). Removed the stale "Phase 0 — skeleton" status block and "Usage (target shape, when complete)" framing — package is published and in use. Architecture diagram annotation corrected to reflect the popup-window OAuth flow.
  - **sdk-react**: translated README from Russian to English to match the other two packages. Added required `apiOrigin` to Quick start and SSR/Next.js examples.

### Minor Changes

- Initial alpha release of `@monetize.software/sdk-react` — React bindings for `@monetize.software/sdk`.

  Includes:

  - `<PaywallProvider>` with two modes: `options={...}` (Provider creates the instance) or `instance={...}` (host supplies a ready PaywallUI from sdk-extension or a shared singleton)
  - 8 hooks: `usePaywall`, `usePaywallState`, `usePaywallUser`, `usePaywallAccess`, `usePaywallPrices`, `usePaywallEvent`, `usePaywallTrial`, `usePaywallVisibility`
  - 3 declarative components: `<PaywallGate>`, `<PaywallButton>`, `<PaywallSupportButton>`
  - `'use client'` directive for Next.js App Router and other RSC-aware bundlers
  - Type-level contract (`src/contract.ts`) that breaks the build at `tsc` time if the public surface of `@monetize.software/sdk` shifts

  SSR-safe out of the box (Next.js, Remix, Astro, RSC). Bundle: ~2 KB gzip.
